Table name: `lat_lattices`

This table stores lattices (free Z-modules with a nondegenerate symmetric inner product) up to isomorphism.

Label: `dimension.signature.determinant.genus_spec.tiebreaker` where

- `genus_spec` is

  - ommitted if determinant is 1 and signature is not a multiple of 8
  - 0 for the even lattice and 1 for the odd in the case that determinant is 1 and signature is a multiple of 8
  - otherwise, for each p with p^2|determinant, we give the concatenated dimensions of the p,p^2,p^3... blocks in the Jordan decomposition (using lower case letters and then upper case letters if these dimensions are larger than 9; we separate different primes with periods.  Finally, we encode the rest of the genus information (sign, scale, oddity etc) into a single integer as described below, and append it to the Jordan information.  This integer will be even if the genus is even and odd if the genus is odd.
  - Label is in the format r.s.d.j_1.j_2....j_k.x, where
    - r is the rank of the lattice
    - s is n_plus, the number of 1s in the diagonalization over R.
    - d is the absolute value of the determinant
    - If p_1, ... , p_k are the primes whose squares divide `2*d` `(p_i^2 | 2*d)`, then
    j_1,...,j_k are corresponding rank decompositions of their Jordan forms, omitting the first, encoded in base 62 (digits 0-9, then lowercase a-z then uppercase A-Z)
    For example, if the pairs of (valuation, rank) appearing in the decomposition are (3, 1), (4,10), (6,37), it will be encoded as 01a0B (the 0s come from the fact that the rank at valuations 2 and 5 are 0).
    - The last component of the label, x, is a hexadecimal string whose bits represent the local data.
    - Let n_2 be the number of non-zero blocks in the Jordan decomposition at 2.
    - The least n_2 bits specify the types (I or II) of the non-zero blocks at 2.
    - From these, once can deduce the compartments and trains in the local symbol at 2, let c, t be their numbers.
    - The next 3*c bits represent the oddities of the compartments, with every 3 bits giving an oddity mod 8.
    - The next t bits represent the signs of the trains.
    - Finally, for every other prime p dividing d, in increasing order, if there are n_p non-zero blocks in the Jordan decomposition at p, we add n_p bits representing the signs of these blocks.
  - For the tiebreaker, we use lexicographic sorting by canonical Gram matrix for definite lattices.  For indefinite lattices, a tiebreaker is only needed in rank 2 or 3 (in rank 3 spinor genera provide a complete invariant).
